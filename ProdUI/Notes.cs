        RadFluidContentControl - allows for three sizes of content by using three different ContentControl templates
            supports custom transition animations / content switching can be triggered or left based on application size

        RadNavigationView (hamburger menu) could be useful?

        RadPersistenceFramework - allows saving and restoring UI - probably going to need this eventually
