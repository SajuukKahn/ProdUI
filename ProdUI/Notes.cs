        General Questions:
            - Are the COM Dependencies laid out appropriately?  How would it be best to do this, as I don't think the multiple references between projects seems right?
            - Is there a clear example in NextGen of a service that I can study for reference?
            - Any changes you would like to see as far as look / feel of the app?
            - Any guide / advice for altering the Telerik controls looks?  I haven't found anything that shows me how to just re-style small parts, such as a specific button's hightlight / mouseover color

        Ideas for next steps:

            + Refactor the ProgramSelectView and ProgramSelectViewModel and associated class objects into another project to further separate concerns
            + Interface all of the concrete classes and resolve within Unity container / factories in appropriate projects
            + Add more Interfaces to universalize properties within classes and Interfaces
            + Eliminate the EventAggregator and all PubSubEvent inheriting classes and replace with services 
            + More work on the UI... Not sure how I want it to look but it's been difficult to improve it
            + Add ability to spawn multiple process regions
            + Add 'floating' window for Program Selection to decouple from other views entirely
