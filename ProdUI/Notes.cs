        RadFluidContentControl - allows for three sizes of content by using three different ContentControl templates
            supports custom transition animations / content switching can be triggered or left based on application size

        RadLayoutControl - allows arrangement of visual elements within its boundaries during runtime
            could be useful for displaying multiple arrangements of AC windows

        RadMulitColumnComboBox - definite for the selection of programs

        RadNavigationView (hamburger menu) could be useful?

        RadPersistenceFramework - allows saving and restoring UI - probably going to need this eventually
